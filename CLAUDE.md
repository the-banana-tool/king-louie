# king-louie

Electron desktop chat app. Main process in `main.js`, renderer in `renderer.js`,
tools and providers under `src/`.

## Testing

Tests use **node's built-in test runner** (`node --test`), not Jest. Do not
invoke `jest` or `npx jest` — Jest will report "Test suite must contain at
least one test" because the files use `node:test`'s `describe`/`it` API and
no `test()`/`it()` calls jest can detect, and you'll miss real failures.

Run tests with:
- `npm test` — full suite (`node --test tests/*.test.js`)
- `node --test tests/<file>.test.js` — single file
- `npm run test:e2e` — sequential e2e suite

When iterating on a specific module, run just its test file directly with
`node --test`. Output uses TAP format; look for `# fail 0` / `# pass N` in the
summary block.

`npm run test:e2e` launches the real Electron binary (`tests/e2e/helpers.js`),
so it needs `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` actually gone from the environment, not set
to an empty string — `tests/e2e/helpers.js` passes `process.env` through
unfiltered, and Electron treats an empty value the same as `1`. From an agent
shell:

```bash
unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && npm run test:e2e
```

Unit tests (`npm test`) don't launch Electron and are unaffected either way.

## Running the app

`npm start` launches Electron normally. If it dies instantly with
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'registerSchemesAsPrivileged')`
at `main.js:9`, the environment has `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` set — that makes
the Electron binary run as plain Node, so `app`, `protocol`, and `BrowserWindow`
are all undefined.

**This is the normal state of an agent shell.** Electron-based tools (VS Code's
integrated terminal, Electron-based CLI agents) set it for their own child
processes and it is inherited. Setting it to an empty string is **not**
enough — Electron treats a present-but-empty `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` the same
as `1` and still crashes at the same line. It has to be removed from the
environment entirely:

```bash
unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && npm start
```

To drive the UI programmatically, use Playwright's `_electron` — it is already a
dependency. Launch `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe` (or
`dist/electron` on Linux, `dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron` on macOS)
and **delete `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` from the env you pass the child**, or the
launch fails with "Process failed to launch!". Pass
`--user-data-dir=<temp path>` to get a clean profile instead of mutating real
chats, settings, and the vault.

Click through `page.evaluate(() => document.getElementById(id).click())` rather
than `locator.click()`, and remember the onboarding wizard appears on a fresh
profile (`#wizard-skip-btn` dismisses it).

## Service mode

`node bin/king-louie-service.js run --data-dir <tmp> --profile agent` runs King Louie
headless (no Electron — `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is irrelevant here). Everything under
`src/` must stay Electron-free except `src/ipc/`; `tests/electron-boundary.test.js`
enforces it. Host-specific behaviour is injected into `createCore(deps)` (`src/core/`).

## Logging

Use `createLogger` from `src/logging.js` instead of bare `console.*` calls.
Loggers are scoped by subsystem name and support hierarchical children,
level filtering, and structured metadata.

```js
const { createLogger } = require('./logging');   // or '../logging' from subdirs
const log = createLogger('my-module');

log.info('something happened');
log.warn('degraded', { latencyMs: 430 });

const child = log.child('sub-part');             // → [my-module/sub-part]
const bound = log.withContext({ sessionId: 's-1' }); // metadata on every call
```

Levels (low → high): `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `silent`.
Default is `info`. Override with `KING_LOUIE_LOG_LEVEL` or `LOG_LEVEL` env var.

## Cases

`src/cases/` implements case repositories (spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-king-louie-cases-design.md`). A case is a
git repo under `<dataDir>/cases/` (override with `settings.cases.root` or
`KL_CASES_ROOT`), so **`git` must be on PATH** for anything that creates one.

- A chat with `caseId` runs every turn in case mode: `CaseRuntime.beginTurn`
  locks the case and builds the orientation, `endTurn` commits.
- The model writes the case only through the `Ledger`, `Brief`, `Decide` and
  `Recommend` tools. `facts.jsonl` is append-only; never rewrite it in code.
- Tests that create cases use a temp root. The e2e suite sets
  `KL_CASES_ROOT` before launching the app so the real profile is untouched.
- `provenance: 'user'` (a Ledger assert, and the Brief owner-only fields `why`,
  `hardConstraints`, `alreadyTried`) must carry a `quote` that appears in
  `caseContext.ownerMessages`. The chat send path fills that list with the
  owner's own messages. Without a match, the tool refuses. Tests that exercise
  user provenance must supply `ownerMessages`.
